Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nDevelopment app link\nhttps://torbalansky.github.io/myFlix-Angular-client/\nFeatures\n\nWelcome View: Upon launching the app, users are greeted with a welcome view. From here, they have the option to either log in or register a new account.\n\nMain \"All-Movies\" View: Once authenticated, users are taken to the main \"all-movies\" view. Here, they can explore a collection of movies. \n\nPersonalized Navbar: The navbar is tailored to each user and provides convenient access to various areas of the app. It includes a menu that allows users to navigate to their profile area and log out when needed.\n\nMovie Details and Actions: Each movie is presented as an individual card, offering additional features. These include:\n\nGenre Details: Clicking a button opens a dialog that provides details about the specific genre of the movie.\nPlot Synopsis: Clicking a button opens a dialog that reveals the plot synopsis of the movie.\nFavorite List Management: Users can add or delete movies from their favorite list using the dedicated button.\n\n\n\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules -
